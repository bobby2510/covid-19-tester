# covid-19-tester
 this is a machine learing project which will predict whether the person with given symptoms is infected with covid-19 disease or not 
 in this project i have used different classification models and figured out best model with hyper parameter tunning method using GridSearchCV along with KFolds cross validation 
 Finally I used LogisticRegression model to predict the answer.
